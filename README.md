# chess-srs

This is a yet-untitled project to make a free and open source standalone spaced repetition training app for chess positions.

## Why?

I love Anki for language flashcards, but I've never been satisfied with my attempts to hack interactive chessboards into Anki cards. It's possible, but the result isn't super pleasant to use. I am also a big fan of Chessable, but it's not as richly customizable as Anki and it is heavily geared towards studying paid pre-made courses offered in the store. I want an app that gives the user full control over the content like Anki does, but one that's built from the ground up with chess in mind.

## Features

### Current Features:
- None! Currently, this is just the empty shell of an Electron app with a boostrap starter template and no functionality. It will not be a usable app until all the features in the short-term section are completed.

### Planned Features (Short-term):
- Integrate [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) from lichess as a chess GUI
- Import positions from PGN and FEN
- Input solution and alternative moves on an analysis board
- Solving view to quiz yourself on the positions
- SRS scheduler to determine when to serve a position
- Import and export collections as PGN databases for maximum compatibility

### Planned Features (Long-term):
- Import positions from image
- Engine integration
- Sync progress between devices
